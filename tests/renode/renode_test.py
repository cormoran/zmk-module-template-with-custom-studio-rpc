"""Hardware-free functional test: boot this module's firmware in the Renode
emulator and exercise its own custom Studio RPC subsystem end to end.

This is the one test file a real module built from this template is
expected to rewrite -- everything generic (booting, the core Studio RPC
GetDeviceInfo round-trip) already ran as the "smoke test" step of the
`zmk-renode-test` GitHub Action (see cormoran/zmk-west-commands's
`.github/actions/zmk-renode-test/`) before this file even runs. This file
only needs to know about *this module's own* RPC surface.

Wiring: `west zmk-renode-test tests/renode --elf <ELF>` sets `ZMK_RENODE_ELF`
and puts `renode_harness` (zmk-west-commands' scripts/lib/renode) on
PYTHONPATH -- see README.md's "Hardware-free Renode testing" section and
zmk-west-commands' README for the rest.

*** KNOWN RENODE-ENVIRONMENT LIMITATION, found by this test suite (2026-07-08) ***
Under Renode -- and, as far as we know, ONLY under Renode; the same code
path is hardware-validated in zmk-feature-studio-rpc-perf -- Studio RPC
responses that go through a *registered* custom subsystem's callback-based
response encoding (`ZMK_RPC_CUSTOM_SUBSYSTEM_RESPONSE_BUFFER_ALLOCATE` /
`zmk_rpc_custom_subsystem_encode_response_payload`) stop being delivered
once the response grows past a few tens of bytes, or after a couple of
successful smaller round trips:

  - zmk-feature-studio-rpc-perf (SAME vendored ZMK fork commit 618f083,
    same custom-subsystem macros, validated on real hardware): under
    Renode, a ~28-byte framed custom response round-trips OK twice, then
    the third request times out; a first-call response of ~55-65 bytes
    framed times out immediately.
  - This template's SampleResponse (~51 bytes framed) and its own
    ErrorResponse both time out on the very first call.
  - Small, callback-free responses stay reliable indefinitely: core
    GetDeviceInfo (~21B; the action's smoke test), and meta.simple_error
    (~10B; see test_custom_rpc_invalid_index_dispatch below -- a genuine,
    affirmative proof the custom envelope/dispatch machinery itself works:
    framing, oneof selection, index validation).

During the hang the firmware is NOT crashed: Renode's
`sysbus.cpu ExecutedInstructions` keeps growing steadily and
`sysbus.cpu PC` samples land inside `ring_buf_area_claim`/
`ring_buf_area_finish` (dependencies/zephyr/lib/utils/ring_buffer.c),
consistent with the studio RPC TX path waiting on a TX ring buffer that
never drains. Ruled out individually: request-delivery timing (byte-paced
UART sends behave identically), CONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_RPC_RX_BUF_SIZE (30 vs
128), CONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO_RPC_TX_BUF_SIZE (64 vs 256, verified in .config),
and always-enabling the TX IRQ in the Renode UART transport module. The
precise mechanism (most plausibly an interaction between rpc.c's
tx_notify batching heuristics and Renode's nRF52840 UARTE TX-interrupt
model) was deliberately not chased further -- it does not affect real
hardware, and fixing it means emulator/harness work, not module work.

Per this project's own convention for documented-but-not-chased-further
findings, the real
end-to-end round trip is captured below as a test that asserts the *known
failure under Renode* (so a future harness/emulator fix will make it
visibly start failing, prompting an update) rather than silently skipped.

(Named `renode_test.py`, not `test_renode.py`, on purpose: it needs a real
firmware ELF, so it must stay out of `python3 -m unittest`'s `test*.py`
auto-discovery.)
